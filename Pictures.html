          <p>Here are a few pictures that I feel represent me in some form, either big or small!</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic1.jpg">
          <h5>A high angle shot of the bridge in Kean Skylands, one of the Kean Campuses.</h5>
	  <p>This image of the sky bridge at Kean Skylands shows my fear of heights, it's really tall! The tour guide that toured the campus with us told us it was as high as the highest ride in Six Flags, I don't believe that's true. Despite the fear, I still went on and walked it, it was fun!</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic2.jpg">
          <h5>A bird's eye view shot of a glass of lemonade.</h5>
	  <p>I absolutely love to drink. Not alcohol! I'm not old enough for that! Besides, I wouldn't end up liking it. Though for any other drink, I thirst, I'm parched without a drink.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic3.jpg">
          <h5>A bird's eye view shot of a plate of potatoes, bacon, and eggs.</h5>
	  <p>I don't usually end up eating much, though that doesn't mean I don't like to eat! I love eating whatever I eat, especially Kean's food, or even better, my mother's cooking.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic4.jpg">
          <h5>A low angle shot of an amazing tasting sandwich I made at home, consisting of eggs, uncured white turkey, american cheese, cut up sausages, and mayonnaise.</h5>
	  <p>Again. I love to eat. I made this sandwich at home and absolutely devoured every last bite. I wish I had more of it.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic5.jpg">
          <h5>A bird's eye view shot of one of my cats, Cleo.</h5>
	  <p>If you asked me "Cats or Dogs?" I'd quickly respond cats, I absolutely love cats, especially because they require less attention than a dog, of course, you'd still need to care for them quite a lot. This is actually one of my three cats, Cleo. The other two are both tuxedo cats, Pablo and Coco. Tuxedo cats are probably my favorite.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic6.jpg">
          <h5>A high angle shot of a Hawaiian shirt decorated with skulls and bones.</h5>
	  <p>I'm not a fashion guy whatsoever, however I believe this picture best represents the type of aesthetic I love most. I'm not sure what best to call it other than grim.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic7.jpg">
          <h5>A low angle shot of my house's toilet.</h5>
	  <p>This is a toilet from my home. It represents me because of a silly and disgusting story I have with this toilet that I will not share. Trust me, it's disgusting.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic8.jpg">
          <h5>A low angle shot of the lake's water at Kean Skylands.</h5>
	  <p>I'm really bad at fishing. One time I went fishing with my father, we lost the rod's bobber and an unopened can of Coca-Cola to the water. However, I still like fish in general.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic9.jpg">
          <h5>A bird's eye view shot of my Nintendo Switch on a table.</h5>
	  <p>I play a lot of video games, mainly computer games now, but most of my elementary school days were spent hunched over a WII U and my middle school days with this Nintendo Switch. My favorite video game character has got to be Sonic the Hedgehog, I know far too much about this silly and speedy creature.</p>
          <img src="/images/keanubpic10.jpg">
          <h5>A bird's eye view shot of the shoes I wear.</h5>
	  <p>Though these shoes are rather new to my feet, I feel I'll be wearing them for a few years, much like my last pair of shoes. I didn't want to part with my last pair due to them having sentimental value. The more weary my shoes, the more memories it has.</p>
